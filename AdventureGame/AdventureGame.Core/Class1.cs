            /* To begin, I want a 5x5 tile that has 3 doors, left, right, and center. 
             The whole maze should be 15 across, with the each tile space being 5x5
            
            The starting tile should generate a bottom left, right, and middle tile.
            The left wing should have more monsters and items, but less dead ends
            The right wing will be safe(er), but not guaranteed to be passable
            The middle will be a mix

        When the player interacts with a door, generate a tile based on the current coordinates 
            Example: if in the bottom left, create a middle left.
            You can probably get soft-locked. So include a reset button
